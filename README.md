# AgeCounter_ReactRef
Just a little simple React ref component that will calculate your age in real time. A great way to remind yourself of impending doom!
I recieve a lot of compliments for this on my about me, so I figured I'd share!

Check out the demo on my about me [here](https://www.kyleecodes.com/about)!
